# Become an Olympian

### Final Project of Team Under the SEA 
Members: Annabelle Paterson, Emma Freeman, Seeam Noor

### About
Our project allows you to explore factors that you can change to maximize your chances on being an Olympian. Through elegant interactive visualizations created using the JavaScript D3 library, you will be able to explore questions like: Being in which country can maximize your chances of being an Olympiad athlete/medalist? What sports should you play based on your sex, height, & weight? Which age are you mostly likely to peak at in your Olympic career?
